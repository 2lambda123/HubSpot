## Changes in `0.15.0`

Check out the [0.15.0 milestone](https://github.com/HubSpot/Singularity/issues?q=milestone%3A%0.15.0+is%3Aclosed) to see new features / bugfixes in detail.

### New Features
- [1519](https://github.com/HubSpot/Singularity/pull/1519) - Spread to all slaves

Adds a best effort attempt to deploy a task on all slaves. You can enable this by adding `spreadAllSlavesEnabled: true` to your Singularity yaml file.

- [1405](https://github.com/HubSpot/Singularity/pull/1405) - Slave Usage Monitoring UI

In the Admin drop-down on the UI, there is now a `Slave Usage` monitoring page. This page contains visualizations about resource usages amongst all the slaves. The circular progress meters display the percent of total resources utilized on all slaves. The resources (cpu and memory) heat map displays percentage utilized per slave.
