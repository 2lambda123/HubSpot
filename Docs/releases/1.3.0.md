## Changes in `1.3.0`

Check out the [1.3.0 milestone](https://github.com/HubSpot/Singularity/milestone/44) to see new features / bugfixes in detail. This release contains a few major items worth calling out separately:

- [2103](https://github.com/HubSpot/Singularity/pull/2103) and [2133](https://github.com/HubSpot/Singularity/pull/2133) adds a long overdue rename of Singularity Slave -> Agent. This is implemented across endpoint names, json bodies, and the java client. All method names/class names/endpoints should be backwards compatible. Old methods are marked as deprecated and will be removed in a future release (TBD).
- [2092](https://github.com/HubSpot/Singularity/pull/2092) reworks singularity webhook auth to add a new version with more granular permissions. This will allow groups as well as scopes to be taken into account to more easily limit read, read/write, admin actions across users
